The Alien (Wenlock) comes down reaches the Earth's atmosphere on the back of a observatory mission. The cloaking device is deployed on the transport so that it is invisible as it decends to the ground.

Wenlock spots a signs of life. 2 beings or organisms and decides to exit the transport. To remain covert, Wenlock has the ability to form into an object in it's proximity. There is a green still object so it goes for that (cactus).

The 2 beings are nearby. Wenlock carefully observes the features of the beings: 4 limbs with fingers, standing upright, move around on 2 limbs, furry type substance on the top of what looks like a cranial shape.

Wenlock observes their beahviour. They look to be social beings that interact with each other. After a few more hours of observing, Wenlock heads back. 

In conclusion, Wenlock's note describe the beings/creatures as interesting but signs of sophisticated intelligence are lacking and still developing. The mission to look for signs of superior civilisation continues.
